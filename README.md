## Theme

According to Citizen Police Data Project from Invisible Institute and several big
news related to misconduct behaviors of police including the death of George
Floyd on May 25th, 2020, we find that some involved police officers show
demographic differences focusing on seniority of a police(eg. Salary, awards ) and
their kinds of misconduct are also different along with their demographic
difference. Nevertheless, detailed analysis on the demographics of officers is
supposed to be provided to see if our guess is true. With it, statistically significant
correlations can be drawn to guide actionable policy changes and to avoid future
similar misconducts.


Our theme is to explore the relationship between the misconducts in police officers
and their career development. To be more specific, we are going to find if the
misconduct in enforcement of a police officer can be reflected properly by his/her
career. For example, if a group of officers have higher average salary than others at
the same rank, will their number of misconducts be higher or lower than others?
How does the number or frequency of misconducts for an officer become after a
change on his/her career(eg. an honor mention, award, promotion, salary change)?
