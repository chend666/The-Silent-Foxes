### Q2 ###

What percentage of total complaints are these officers who have received an honor mention or award responsible for?
```
--drop table if exists
drop table officer_complaint;
drop table number_complaint;

create table officer_complaint as

### Q3 ###

What is the percentage of officers who were disciplined in an allegation get an honor mention or awards?

select query for:

--officers who were disciplined in a complaint

--officers who were disciplined in a complaint,get awards
```
select
(select count(distinct officer_id) as disciplined_officer from data_officerallegation

```

### Q4 ###

Can the total number or frequency of complaints received by the officer be reflected by his/her career advancement(whether an officer holding an award in a year receives less or no complaint)?

### Q5 ###

Is there a relationship between the change of frequency of an officer who gets allegations and the change of his/her salary(if any)?
```
-- pull out table

SELECT

where year = 2005),

-- Pull out AVG salary for 2007
(SELECT avg(salary) as AVG_2007 from data_salary
where year = 2007),
-- Pull out AVG salary for 2008
(SELECT avg(salary) as AVG_2008 from data_salary

---------------------------------------------------
